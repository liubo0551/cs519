\section*{Tring to make a water simulation shader}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Try to implement a sine wave like water wave. I found a paper at \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/content/gpu-gems-chapter-1-effective-water-simulation-physical-models}{\textit{GPU Gems: Chapter 1. Effective Water Simulation from Physical Models}} , authored by Mark Finch and Cyan Worlds. I would dive in and than implement my own shader. 
  \item May adding some noise to the shader waves. These noise my be a little different from what we done in homeworks because I want to make it realistic.
  \item Last thing, if possible, I would adding cube mapping to create a reflection effect.
\end{itemize}
